 * Panel interfaces implemented to show additional details of a particular view.

 * The panel interface can be implemented to show additional details of a
 * {@link View}. The panel will be shown in a split view below the main view
 * when activated. Panels should implement the {@link UIElement.available} property to
 * indicate for which state of the application the panel is active. This usually
 * involves checking which view is currently active using
 * {@link Application.current_view}.
 *
 * Each panel should have a unique id, a display name and an icon which will
 * be used in the interface to activate the panel. The {@link UIElement.widget} is
 * displayed when the panel is activated.
